The project "Face Mask detection using Deep Learning in Keras" uses deep learning, openCV library and the Keras framework to determine if a person is hiding their face. The purpose of this project is to create a system that can automatically recognise and categorise people based on their facial characteristics, with a particular emphasis on whether or not they are wearing a face mask. The project's goal is to achieve high accuracy in real-time face mask detection using a deep learning model. This has potential in a number of settings, including security systems, healthcare, and the monitoring of mask-wearing protocols in public.
